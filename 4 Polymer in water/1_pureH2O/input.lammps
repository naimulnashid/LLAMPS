# Preparing the water reservoir
units real    # Specifies that the simulation uses the "real" units system, where distances are in angstroms, time is in femtoseconds, energies are in kcal/mol, etc. This unit system is typically used for molecular simulations.
atom_style full    # Defines the style of atoms in the simulation, including full information on molecular topology (bonds, angles, dihedrals). This is necessary for simulations involving complex molecules like water.
bond_style harmonic    # Defines the bond interactions using a harmonic potential.
angle_style harmonic    # Defines the angle interactions using a harmonic potential.
dihedral_style harmonic    # Defines the dihedral interactions using a harmonic potential.
