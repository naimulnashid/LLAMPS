dimension 3    # Specifies that the simulation is in three dimensions.
boundary p p p    # Sets the boundary conditions in the x, y, and z directions to periodic (p), meaning the system will wrap around at the boundaries.
atom_style atomic    # Defines the style of atoms being simulated as atomic, which is suitable for simulations of individual atoms without internal structure.
variable latparam equal 4.05    # Defines a variable latparam, which is set to 4.05, representing the lattice parameter (in angstroms) of the FCC lattice of aluminum.

region upper block INF INF INF INF INF INF units box    # Defines another region upper that extends infinitely in all directions (but is effectively the entire box since it covers the whole space).

## Store final cell length for strain calculations
variable tmp equal "lx"    # Defines a variable named tmp and assigns it the current length of the simulation box in the x-direction (lx). lx is a built-in LAMMPS variable that represents the x-dimension of the simulation box.
variable L0 equal ${tmp}    # Defines a variable named L0 and assigns it the value stored in tmp, which is the initial length of the simulation box in the x-direction. This variable will be used as a reference length (L0) for strain calculations.
print "Initial Length, L0: ${L0}"    # Outputs the initial length of the simulation box (L0) to the screen or log file. This allows the user to see the initial length of the simulation box before any deformation occurs.
